# Sign-Language-Translator
In today's world, communication barriers often isolate individuals with hearing and speech impairments from society. Sign language is a powerful tool for communication, but it is not widely understood by the general public. Our goal is to bridge this communication gap by creating a **Real-Time Sign Language to Speech Converter** that translates sign language gestures into spoken words. 

## Objective
To develop a system that leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into audible speech in real time, enabling smoother interaction for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Features
- **Real-Time Translation:** Instantaneous conversion of sign language gestures into speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and accessible UI for easy usage.
- **Portability:** Can run on standard devices with a camera.
